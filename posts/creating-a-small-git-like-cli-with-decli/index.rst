.. description: tutorial to write a command line interface with python decli
.. type: text

So for a long time I've been using different cli tools, mostly :code:`argparse` because this way I had zero dependencies,
less worries, this is pure personal preference.

Other tools such as click or docopt, the way the code must be written, is not something I'm really fond of.

Because of this, I created `decli <https://github.com/Woile/decli>`__, which is a declarative command line utility. Super simple.
Which is basically a wrapper around argparse.
Just write a dict and you are ready to go.

In this tutorial we are gonna try to simulate a *git command line tool*.
Let's create a few commands which will just print a message.

But we are gonna structure the code, the way I always wanted to hehe.

The commands will be decoupled from the *command line interface* (cli from now on).

.. TEASER_END

These are the git commands we are gonna cover:

::

    add
    commit
    push

Our file structure will result in something like this:

::

    git-demo
    ├── git
    │   ├── commands
    │   │   ├── __init__.py
    │   │   ├── add.py
    │   │   ├── commit.py
    │   │   └── push.py
    │   ├── __init__.py
    │   └── __main__.py
    └── pyproject.toml

If you are gonna write code along with the tutorial, you can create those files already. You can skip the **pyproject.toml**.

The code for this tutorial is `hosted in github <https://github.com/Woile/decli-git-demo>`_.

Installation
------------

.. warning::

    Python3! Everything here is python3!

I like the new package manager :code:`poetry` which uses the new **pyproject.toml** file. So let's install:

::

    poetry add decli

Otherwise if you want to use pip:

::

    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -U decli

The pyproject.toml file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you haven't seen how a **pyproject.toml** looks, it's something like this:

::

    [tool.poetry]
    name = "decli-git-demo"
    version = "0.1.0"
    description = "A git like demo"

    [tool.poetry.dependencies]
    python = "*"
    decli = "^0.5.0"

    [tool.poetry.dev-dependencies]
    pytest = "^3.0"
    flake8 = "^3.5"
    mypy = "^0.620.0"

Pretty simple, right?

Writing the interface
---------------------

We are gonna write the **cli** in the :code:`___main__.py` file, so we can treat the folder :code:`git` as a module.
Look at the file structure if in doubt.

In order to use it as a module, we need to provide the :code:`-m` flag, to the python interpreter.
Our resulting command would look something like this:

:code:`python -m git <top_level_arguments> <subcommand> <sub_arguments>`.

Example:

::

    python -m git --debug commit --amend

For the interface, using **decli**, we need to create a dict. Let's dive into it.

Main component
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: python

    from decli import cli

    data = {
        "prog": "git",
        "description": "These are common Git commands used in various situations"
    }

    parser = cli(data)
    args = parser.parse_args()

This part is the entrypoint of our cli.

The :code:`prog` key is the name of the app, it will be used in the help information, same as :code:`description`.
Let's see how this works:

::

    $ python -m git --help
    usage: git [-h]

    These are common Git commands used in various situations

    optional arguments:
    -h, --help  show this help message and exit

Arguments
~~~~~~~~~

Let's add some global arguments, we want to have :code:`debug` and :code:`version` available.
We are also going to add some code to handle the version flag.
And for now, if nothing is provided we'll print the args.

.. code-block:: python

    import sys
    from decli import cli

    data = {
        "prog": "git",
        "description": "These are common Git commands used in various situations",
        "arguments": [
            {"name": ["-v", "--version"], "action": "store_true"},
            {"name": "--debug", "action": "store_true"},
        ],
    }

    parser = cli(data)
    args = parser.parse_args()

    if args.version:
        print("0.1.0")
        sys.exit(0)

    print(args)

Let's take a look at the help, also to what happens when calling with the :code:`version` flag, and when nothing is provided.

::

    $ python -m git --help
    usage: git [-h] [-v] [--debug]

    These are common Git commands used in various situations

    optional arguments:
    -h, --help     show this help message and exit
    -v, --version
    --debug

::

    $ python -m git --version
    0.1.0

::

    $ python -m git
    Namespace(debug=False, version=False)

Awesome, this is looking promising.

Subcommands
~~~~~~~~~~~

Last thing we are missing are the subcommands, we said we were gonna cover :code:`add`, :code:`commit`, and :code:`push`.
Each one will have a unique sub-argument (just as an example).
Also, each one will use a class that we are gonna implement later. So no output example for now.

Some extras:

- We are gonna print the help if nothing is provided.
- We are gonna call a :code:`run` method from the classes that we are gonna define later.


.. code-block:: python

    import sys
    from decli import cli
    from .commands import Add, Commit, Push

    data = {
        "prog": "git",
        "description": "These are common Git commands used in various situations",
        "arguments": [
            {"name": ["-v", "--version"], "action": "store_true"},
            {"name": "--debug", "action": "store_true"},
        ],
        "subcommands": {
            "title": "main",
            "commands": [
                {
                    "name": "add",
                    "help": "Add file contents to the index",
                    "func": Add,
                    "arguments": [{"name": "--update", "action": "store_true"}],
                },
                {
                    "name": "commit",
                    "help": "Record changes to the repository",
                    "func": Commit,
                    "arguments": [
                        {
                            "name": "--amend",
                            "action": "store_true",
                            "help": (
                                "Replace the tip of the current "
                                "branch by creating a new commit."
                            ),
                        }
                    ],
                },
                {
                    "name": "push",
                    "help": "Update remote refs along with associated objects",
                    "func": Push,
                    "arguments": [
                        {
                            "name": "--tags",
                            "action": "store_true",
                            "help": (
                                "All refs under refs/tags are pushed, in"
                                " addition to refspecs explicitly listed "
                                "on the command line."
                            ),
                        }
                    ],
                },
            ],
        },
    }

    parser = cli(data)
    args = parser.parse_args()

    if args.version:
        print("0.1.0")
        sys.exit(0)

    # print help if no arguments are provided
    if len(sys.argv) < 2:
        parser.print_help()
        sys.exit()

    cmd = args.func(**args.__dict__)
    cmd.run()

So this is how :code:`___main__.py` should look like.


Writing the commands
--------------------

Before, we left our application unfinished and not working, because it was missing the classes imported from the :code:`commands` folder.
If you haven't created the folder and the files yet, go and do it. Remember also to create the :code:`___init__.py` files.

It's interesting to observe how each class is unpacking the arguments that needs.

Also, each class is a normal python class, there's nothing needed, really **easy to test**, right?

A better implementation could be made, of course, having a parent class defining the interface and handling global arguments, would be interesting.
But I'll leave that for you.

Add
~~~

For :code:`commands/app.py`

.. code-block:: python

    class Add:

        def __init__(self, debug=False, update=False, **kwargs):
            self.debug = debug
            self.update = update

        def run(self):
            print(f'running add... update: {self.update}, debug: {self.debug}')

Commit
~~~~~~

For :code:`commands/commit.py`

.. code-block:: python

    class Commit:

        def __init__(self, debug=False, amend=False, **kwargs):
            self.debug = debug
            self.amend = amend

        def run(self):
            print(f'Commiting... debug: {self.debug}, amend: {self.amend}')

Push
~~~~

For :code:`commands/push.py`

.. code-block:: python

    class Push:

        def __init__(self, debug=False, tags=False, **kwargs):
            self.debug = debug
            self.tags = tags

        def run(self):
            print(f'Pushing... debug: {self.debug}, tags: {self.tags}')

Init
~~~~

We are gonna add this, in order to import directly from :code:`commands`, instead of one by one.

For :code:`commands/__init__.py`

.. code-block:: python

    from .add import Add
    from .commit import Commit
    from .push import Push

    __all__ = (
        'Add',
        'Commit',
        'Push'
    )

Now what?
---------

That's it, our application is completed, let's see some output results.

Providing nothing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    $ python -m git
    usage: git [-h] [-v] [--debug] {add,commit,push} ...

    These are common Git commands used in various situations

    optional arguments:
    -h, --help         show this help message and exit
    -v, --version
    --debug

    main:
    {add,commit,push}
        add              Add file contents to the index
        commit           Record changes to the repository
        push             Update remote refs along with associated objects

Calling add command
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    $ python -m git add
    running add... update: False, debug: False

Calling commit command with a sub-argument
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    $ python -m git commit --amend
    Commiting... debug: False, amend: True

Calling push command with global and sub arguments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    $ python -m git --debug push --tags
    Pushing... debug: True, tags: True


Help for one of the commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    $ python -m git commit --help
    usage: git commit [-h] [--amend]

    optional arguments:
    -h, --help  show this help message and exit
    --amend     Replace the tip of the current branch by creating a new commit.


And that's it, we have succesfully created a nice and mantainable cli.

Keep in mind that if you already have a project, and you want to provide an interface, now you know how.

Hope it was a useful reading.
