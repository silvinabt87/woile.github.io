.. TEASER_END

Background
----------

For quite some time, I've been trying to solve this problem I had in my mind.
I was looking for a way to store my passwords (I'll refer to them as
secrets also) in a secure way.
But also, I wanted these features:

- Storing passwords in the cloud
- Easy to synchronize between devices
- Easy to share between teammates (groups)

The solution I found was `gopass`_.

How it works
------------

Basically `gopass`_ is like `pass`_ (the unix password manager) with an extra
pair of batteries.

Among others, the features it has, relevant to me, are:

1. Uses **gpg** for secrets encryption.
2. Uses **git** for secrets synchronization.
3. Multiple password's **stores** (personal, company, etc).
4. Each store can point to a different repository.
5. Support for **multiple people** per store, called recipients in the jargon.

Even though it lacks a bit in documentation, the commands just do what's
expected of them. So don't be afraid to play with it.

Regarding gpg, it makes me glad to start wrapping my mind around it, and gopass
using it, well, makes my day :)

The only drawback I found is the lack of official windows support. I don't
know if it works or not in windows.

Installation
------------

You can check the website's `installation`_ or you can go to a more in depth
explanation in gopass `repo`_.

Usage
-----

First of all, we are gonna need a gpg key.
To create one, gopass it's not needed.
Instaed, we are gonna use gpg cli that should be in your system if you have
installed gopass.

**How does gpg work?**

In the context of gopass, we are gonna use the public and private keys provided
by gpg.

Imagine you have an infinite amount of boxes (public key), that once they are
closed, they can only be open with a key that only you have (private key).

From this analogy, we can conclude 2 things:

1. You **can distribute your public keys** and let anyone encrypt
information with it.
Let's say I give boxes to friends, they put something inside and close it.
That's it, only I will be able to open it. And of course, I can also encrypt
my stuff, in case some is sniffing around.

2. **Private keys are really important**, keep them safe, don't lose them,
and make a backup. You can use an encrypted pendrive, a paper note in a
safe place, or a `yubikey`_. Would be nice if companies give yubikeys to their
employees, right?

**Creating a key**

Simple as following the prompt that appears after typing the command.
If you don't know what to fill, use the default values.

.. code:: bash

    gpg --full-generate-key

And check the generatd key

.. code:: bash

    gpg -k


Initializing gopass
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Easy as typing

.. code:: bash

    gopass init

This will set up some stuff and will create the default store.

I recommend adding the autocomplete to your terminal

.. code:: bash

    echo "source <(gopass completion bash)" >> ~/.bashrc

Using gopass
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Gopass works in a "unix" like way.
You'll have a tree (folders) where the leaves are encrypted files.

.. code::

    gopass
        ├── my-company
        │   └── pepe@my-company.com
        └── personal
            └── pepe@personal.com

Let's begin by **inserting** a secret.

.. code:: bash

    gopass insert personal/twitter/santiwilly

It will show a prompt and you'll have to fill the password twice.
The structure I follow is this (most of them optional)
``{store}/{org}/{env}/{username or email}``.

Now let's **list** our secret, by simply doing

.. code:: bash

    gopass ls

We should now see, something like this.

.. code::

    gopass
        ├── my-company
        │   └── pepe@my-company.com
        └── personal
            ├── pepe@personal.com
            └── twitter
                └── santiwilly

Perfect!

Let's continue. I'm just gonna throw you the commands, they don't have any
complexity.

**Show password**

.. code:: bash

    gopass personal/twitter/santiwilly

**Copy password to clipboard**

.. code:: bash

    gopass -c personal/twitter/santiwilly

**Generate random pass**

.. code:: bash

    gopass generate my-company/anothername@rmail.com

**Search secrets**

.. code:: bash

    gopass search @gmail.com

Using stores
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here's were my journey got a bit complicated, as I mentioned the docs are
not necessary bad, but you can get lost, maybe the website could be organized
a bit better. So I ended up creating multiple docker containers and started
playing around.

Stores (AKA **mounts**) let you group your passwords.
Example: :code:`personal`, :code:`company`.
Each one can live in a different repository, and you could potentially,
share :code:`company` with your peers.

**Initialize new store**

Creates a new store located at ``~/.password-store-my-company``.

.. code:: bash

    gopass init --store my-company

**Add git remote to store**

.. code:: bash

    gopass git remote add --store my-company origin git@gh.com/Woile/keys.git

**Clone existing store**

Let's say you move to another computer, now it's where gopass starts to shine.
Whether you use the same private key (imported in different computers) or you
choose to have a key per machine, to clone a repo, you just need
access to it.

.. code:: bash

    gopass clone git@gh.com/Woile/keys.git my-company --sync gitcli

It's important to specify ``gitcli`` as the ``sync`` method. Otherwise gopass
won't know how to synchronize the secret (it will use ``noop`` by default).
Gopass provides other sync methods but I haven't checked them.

Solutions that provide a free private repo are:

- `gitlab`_
- `github`_
- `bitbucket`_

**Removing existing store**

To avoid having issues with gopass, first we need to unmount the store.

.. code:: bash

    gopass mounts umount my-company

Now that we've done this, it's safe to remove the folder.

.. code:: bash

    rm -rf ~/.password-store-my-company

Synchronization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In gopass, sync usually means ``git pull`` and ``git push``, maybe also commit
but I'm not sure. Usually the commits are done on ``gopass insert``.

**Synchronize with git remotes**

.. code:: bash

    gopass sync

**Synchronzing a single store**

.. code:: bash

    gopass sync --store my-company

Team sharing
~~~~~~~~~~~~

We are finally on the last and most fantastic part,
sharing secrets with people.

Suppose we have a colleague with an email ``logan@pm.me``. This person has
already generated a gpg key, for that email, in they machine.

Logan then, must **export the public key** and send it to us.

.. code:: bash

    gpg -a --export logan@pm.me > logan.pub.asc

It's okay, public keys can be shared in untrusted environments. If you are
still not convinced, try `send`_ from firefox. Keep in mind that people share
their public keys in keyservers, like `opengpgkeyserver`_.

**Adding public key into gopass**

We have the public key, now it's time to **import** it into our
local gpg keyring.

.. code:: bash

    gpg --import < logan.pub.asc

And lastly, we need to **add the new key to a gopass store**.

.. code:: bash

    gopass recipients add logan@pm.me

You'll see a prompt with all of your stores. Choose the one you want, and it
will re-encrypt your secrets with the new public key (plus the existing ones).

And that's it, we are done. You can of course remove recipients, but I'll let
you do the search, tip: ``gopass recipients --help``.

Conclusion
----------

I have created a gopass `cheat sheet`_ with these commands and
a `presentation`_ to convince your colleagues.

Gopass is an awesome tool to include in your toolbelt.
Unfortunately, it is not that easy for non-developers, but still possible.

Some extra tools I use to enhance my gopass experience are:

`Android password store`_

I suggest installing it using F-droid, you'll need OpenKey-chain to create
a new gpg key, and you already know how to add multiple recipients to
your stores.

`Gopass bridge`_

Browser extension for Firefox or Chrome that let's you access your stores.

`Gopass UI`_

Electron based UI wrapper for your gopass on the command line.
It makes your life easier by providing a rich graphical user
interface to search and manage your secrets.

Any feedback is welcome, as I'm no security expert and I'd be glad to have a
better and more secure workflow.
